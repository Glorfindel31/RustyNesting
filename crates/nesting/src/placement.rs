//! Port of `background.js`'s single-threaded greedy per-sheet placement
//! loop: `placeParts` + `tryPlacePartOnSheet` + the three placement-type
//! scorers. Phase 3's first end-to-end milestone - no GA, no threads (see
//! `RUST-REWRITE-PLAN.md` and `docs/PORT_STATUS.md`'s Phase 3 table).
//!
//! Simplification vs. the original, not a functional change: the JS side
//! converts every polygon to Clipper's own integer coordinate space by hand
//! (`toClipperCoordinates`/`ScaleUpPath`/`toNestCoordinates`) because the old
//! flat `ClipperLib` API needed manually-oriented, pre-scaled paths. Our
//! `geometry::clipper` wrapper (`crates/geometry/src/clipper.rs`) already
//! does that scaling internally per call (`DeepnestScale`, x10^7) and its
//! boolean ops are true set operations that don't require caller-managed
//! winding for correctness (confirmed by `inner_nfp.rs`'s general fallback,
//! which already composes multiple same-side loops this same way) - so this
//! port works directly in plain `Point` coordinates throughout, with no
//! `nfpToClipperCoordinates`/`toNestCoordinates`-equivalent step needed.
//!
//! Deliberately **not** ported here: `config.mergeLines`'s edge-merge fitness
//! bonus (`mergedLength` in the original). It's an optional scoring nicety,
//! not required for the core placement loop or this milestone's
//! one-rectangle-on-one-sheet correctness goal; the `.exact` per-point
//! marking it depends on isn't tracked on `geometry::Point` yet either. Add
//! both together if/when the edge-merge bonus is needed.

/// `None` if cancelled partway through - a partial placement (some parts

/// or compare against other individuals, so it's discarded entirely rather
/// than returned as if it were a genuine, fully-evaluated attempt.

/// step observation hook for a caller that wants to watch placement happen

/// (`&|_, _| {}`); this adds no behavior of its own.
///
/// `on_candidates(sheet_index, part_id, &candidates)` fires right alongside
