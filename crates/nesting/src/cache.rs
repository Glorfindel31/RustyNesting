//! Port of `main/nfpDb.ts`'s `NfpCache`: an in-memory cache for the
//! (relatively expensive) NFP computations `geometry::obstacle_nfp` and
//! `geometry::inner_nfp` produce, keyed by `crate::cache_key::nfp_cache_key`
//! (Phase 2's unification of what were two separately-maintained key
//! formats).
//!
//! **Threading, a real change from the original, not a 1:1 port**: the
//! Electron app ran one independent, unshared `NfpCache` per background
//! window (6-8 parallel `BrowserWindow` processes, zero cross-window cache
//! sharing - see the plan's Phase 4 scope). This port shares ONE cache
//! across every rayon worker thread instead, behind a `Mutex` (see
//! `docs/PORT_STATUS.md`'s Phase 4 row: "sharded map or plain mutex - verify
//! contention before reaching for anything fancier"). A plain `Mutex` is the
//! honest default until real contention data says otherwise.
//!
//! **Entry-count bookkeeping simplification**: the original hand-tracks an
//! `entryCount` field to avoid `Object.keys(db).length` being O(n) per
//! insert; Rust's `HashMap::len()` is already O(1), so that field isn't
//! needed here.
//!
//! **Clone-on-read/write, simplified by ownership**: the original must
//! explicitly deep-copy every cached NFP on both insert and read
//! (`new Point(p.x, p.y)` per point) because a live NFP-tracing call mutates
//! `Point.marked` in place on whatever array reference it's given - a cache
//! hit returning a shared reference would let one caller's tracing corrupt
//! what a later caller reads. Rust's `Point` is `Copy`, so `Vec<Point>` /
//! `Vec<Vec<Point>>`'s ordinary `.clone()` already produces an independent
//! copy with its own `marked` flags; no custom clone method needed.

/// Each key maps to an `Arc<OnceLock<_>>` "slot", not a plain value - this is
/// what makes `get_or_compute` (the only way in or out) stampede-proof.
/// A first-generation version exposed `has`/`find`/`insert` separately, which
/// left the actual NFP computation happening *between* two lock
/// acquisitions, unlocked: under `dispatch::run_generation`'s `par_iter()`,
/// several rayon threads wanting the same key at once could all miss
/// together, all compute the same (expensive) NFP independently, and race to
/// insert - wasted, duplicated work that defeated the whole point of sharing
/// one cache across threads. A `OnceLock` per key fixes this structurally:
/// the map lock is only ever held long enough to fetch-or-create a key's
/// slot; the actual computation runs outside that lock, and
/// `OnceLock::get_or_init` itself guarantees only the first caller for a
/// given key actually runs `compute`- every other concurrent caller for
/// that same key just blocks until it finishes, then shares the result.
///
/// **This blocking is deliberate and load-bearing, not a bug to "fix" by
/// letting racers duplicate work instead** - confirmed the hard way earlier
/// in this cache's history: a real 170-part/120-sheet job's NFP computation
/// (the Minkowski diff behind `geometry::obstacle_nfp`, on the real
/// post-clearance-offset part shapes) costs single-digit-to-tens of
/// milliseconds per call, not microseconds - see `geometry::clipper::
/// offset_bevel`'s doc comment for why the *input* polygons were far larger
/// than expected (~56 points from a 4-point original) until that was fixed.
/// A non-blocking, duplicate-on-race version of this cache was tried against
/// that same real job and measured *slower* end to end (175s vs 128s for 5
/// generations) - with computation this expensive, letting several threads
/// each redo it independently costs far more than any of them blocking to
