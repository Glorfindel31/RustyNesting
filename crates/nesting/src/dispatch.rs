//! Per-generation dispatch, replacing `main/deepnest.js`'s `launchWorkers`:
//! a 100ms-poll loop that IPC-dispatched one individual at a time to up to
//! `config.threads` separate Electron `BrowserWindow` worker processes,
//! tracking each one's `processing`/`fitness` state by hand to know when a
//! slot freed up.
//!
//! **Replaced by construction, not ported 1:1**: `rayon`'s parallel
//! iteration is synchronous - it blocks the calling thread until every item
//! finishes - so there's no polling loop, no `processing` flag, no manually
//! tracking how many workers are busy. One `par_iter()` call evaluates an
//! entire generation's population at once, capped by rayon's own thread
//! pool instead of a hand-rolled `running < config.threads` check. This is
//! what `docs/PORT_STATUS.md`'s Phase 4 row means by "eliminates the
//! ~7500-buffered-insert IPC flood by construction" - there's no IPC here
//! at all, every worker is a thread in the same process sharing memory.
//!
//! **Not ported here**: progress/log event plumbing (the original's
//! `eventEmitter.send(...)` calls), thread-count tuning against
//! `config.threads` (rayon's default global pool is used as-is - Phase 9's
//! "verify, don't assume" row is where that gets checked against real data,
//! not guessed at here), and `widenRotationsIfStalled`/`refineStalledBest`
//! (need `run`'s caller to track stagnation across calls - left to whatever
//! wraps this loop, same reasoning as the sheets `docs/PORT_STATUS.md` Phase
//! 4 row this superseded).

/// Evaluates every individual in the current generation's population in

/// (`GeneticAlgorithm::generation()`) - unless `should_cancel` cut this
/// generation short, see below. Returns the `PlaceResult` for every
/// individual actually (re-)placed this call - useful for a caller that
/// wants to track the best-so-far result, not just the best fitness (see
/// `is_better_nest`'s doc comment for why those can rank differently).
///
/// Individuals that already carry a `fitness` are skipped, not
/// re-evaluated. The only way that happens is `GeneticAlgorithm::generation`'s
/// elitism (`new_population = vec![self.population[0].clone()]`), which
/// carries the surviving elite's already-correct fitness forward unchanged
/// - its genes didn't change, so its placement result didn't either.
/// Matches the original (`launchWorkers`'s dispatch loop skips any
/// individual whose `.fitness` is already truthy) and skips a real,
/// otherwise-redundant placement computation every generation.
///
/// `should_cancel` is checked once per individual, right before that
/// individual's own placement work starts - not while one is already
/// running; there's no way to abort a `place_parts` call already in flight
/// without restructuring the placement engine itself. Once it returns
/// true, every individual not yet started returns early instead of running
/// a real placement. For a population bigger than the thread pool's
/// parallelism (the common case), that means only the currently in-flight
/// batch - bounded by thread count, not population size - still has to
/// finish, not the whole generation. This is what makes a caller's
/// per-generation cancel check (checking `should_cancel` again between
/// calls to this function) actually responsive instead of only ever
/// taking effect at generation boundaries.
///
/// A cancelled call leaves some individuals without a fitness, so
/// `GeneticAlgorithm::generation()` - which requires every individual's
/// fitness to already be set - is skipped rather than called on a
/// half-evaluated population (it would panic). The caller is expected to
/// stop calling `run_generation` once it observes cancellation, not to
/// treat a cut-short call as a normal completed generation.
///
/// `on_individual_placed(done, total)` is called once up front with
/// `(0, total)` before any placement starts, then again after each
/// individual's `place_parts` call returns - `total` is how many
/// individuals this call will actually evaluate (population size minus any
/// already-fitness'd elite). A single individual's placement is real,
/// possibly tens-of-seconds work against non-trivial real geometry, and
/// without this a caller has no signal at all between "generation started"
/// and "generation finished", which reads as the whole run having stalled
/// even though it's working the entire time.
///
/// `cache` should be the same `NfpCache` for the whole run (every
/// individual, every generation) - see `place_parts`'s own doc comment for
/// why. Every individual in a generation shares the one cache (behind its
/// own internal `Mutex`, safe across `par_iter`'s parallel threads).
