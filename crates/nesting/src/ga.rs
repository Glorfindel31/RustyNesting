//! Port of `main/deepnest.js`'s `GeneticAlgorithm` class and `isBetterNest`.
//! Pure algorithm - no dispatch/threading here (that's `nesting::dispatch`,
//! not yet built); `generation()` just needs every individual's `fitness`
//! already populated by whatever ran placement for this generation.
//!
//! **A gene is a part id (`usize`), not a part object.** The original's
//! `individual.placement` is an array of references to the actual part
//! objects (shared, not deep-copied, by `.slice(0)`); `mate`'s crossover
//! containment check (`contains(gene, id)`) only ever looks at `.id`
//! anyway. Since part geometry (`geometry::dxf_import::LayeredPolygon`) is
//! comparatively expensive to clone (points plus recursive hole children),
//! and the GA reorders/mutates/mates potentially hundreds of individuals a
//! generation, carrying ids instead of geometry keeps every GA operation a
//! cheap `Vec<usize>` shuffle - real part lookup by id is the caller's job
//! (`nesting::placement::NestPart`), same separation of concerns as the
//! original had via object reference vs. `.id`, just made explicit.
//!
//! **`widenRotationsIfStalled` is now ported, but split across two places**:
//! this module only exposes `set_rotations` (widening what future mutations
//! can draw from); the stagnation counter that decides *when* to call it
//! lives in `src-tauri/src/commands.rs`'s generation loop, the caller that
//! actually persists across many `dispatch::run_generation` calls (this
//! module and `nesting::dispatch` both only ever see one generation at a
//! time). **`refineStalledBest` is still not ported** - it re-runs
//! consolidation against a stalled run's current champion, which needs the
//! same generation-loop-level caller `widenRotationsIfStalled` just gained,
//! but doing so hasn't been requested yet.
