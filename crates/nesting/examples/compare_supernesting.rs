//! One-off analysis (not a benchmark): extracts ground-truth numbers from the
//! "supernesting" tool's own reference layouts for the aperiodic "hat"
//! monotile, at 2/20/252 parts on a 500x500mm sheet
//! (`tests/fixtures/supernesting {2,20,252}part(s) 500x500.dxf`). Each
//! reference file embeds a `SheetMat`-layer 500x500 sheet outline plus N
//! already-placed copies of the same hat shape as `tests/fixtures/hat-monotile.dxf`
//! (confirmed by edge-length signature: 12.99/7.5mm edges, sqrt(3):1 ratio,
//! matching the hat's kite construction) - `build_polygon_tree`'s containment
//! nesting puts every part as a child of the sheet root for free, since none
//! of the (disjoint) parts contain each other.
//!
//! Reports reference utilisation (what we need to beat/match) and, per part,
//! its rotation relative to the canonical hat shape (edge0's angle - every
//! placed part shares the same point order/winding as the canonical shape,
//! since these are plain rotate+translate copies) and whether it was
//! mirrored (signed-area sign flip) - direct evidence for whether
//! supernesting draws from a small discrete rotation grid or something wider,
//! and whether mirroring is actually in play here.
//!
//! The three reference files above are **not checked into this repo**
//! (third-party output, pulled manually from the supernesting tool) - this
//! example only runs for whoever has copied them into `tests/fixtures/`
//! locally. The numbers this example was already used to derive are recorded
//! as-is in `hat_test.rs`'s `target_utilisation_pct`; missing files here
//! don't invalidate those, they just mean this particular derivation can't
//! be re-run/audited without sourcing the files again.
//!
//! Usage: `cargo run --release -p nesting --example compare_supernesting`
